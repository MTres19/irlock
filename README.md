# irlock
Arduino program for locking and unlocking a door via infrared

Made for Arduino Uno R3, but may work on other boards as well.

Ken Shirriff's IR library must be installed. See https://github.com/z3t0/Arduino-IRremote/releases for downloads. Download Arduino-IRremote-dev.zip, then in the  Arduino IDE, go to Sketch > Include Library > Add .ZIP Library, and open the ZIP file. If this results in extra #include statements being added to the sketch, remove them, as the library is already included.

You should be using the latest version of the Arduino IDE (v1.6.8 as of this writing).

Currently, there are no releases as I have not tested it.
